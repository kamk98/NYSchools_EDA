# NYSchools_EDA


## About the dataset:
This dataset comprises of information regarding schools all over the state of New York over severall years. Also homes data pertaining to enrollment of students of different ethnicities, genders, enrollment in different language classes etc. It comprises of the following columns: 'DBN', 'Name', 'schoolyear', 'fl_percent', 'frl_percent', 'total_enrollment', 'prek', 'k', 'grade1', 'grade2', 'grade3', 'grade4', 'grade5', 'grade6', 'grade7', 'grade8', 'grade9', 'grade10', 'grade11', 'grade12', 'ell_num', 'ell_percent', 'sped_num', 'sped_percent', 'ctt_num', 'selfcontained_num', 'asian_num', 'asian_per', 'black_num', 'black_per', 'hispanic_num', 'hispanic_per', 'white_num', 'white_per', 'male_num', 'male_per', 'female_num', 'female_per'.

This dataset is originally in an API Endpoint format. Had to convert it into a readable Pandas DataFrame by implementing a comprehensive logic.


## Background
This project was assigned to me as part of a selection round for an internship at FullContact Inc.

## Data Analysis Workflow
First, I had to convert the complex API Endpoint into a readable Pandas DataFrame. Following this, EDA involving finding top 20 schools (by enrollment) over the years (regardless of which grades they took in students for), progress of enrollment of students of different ethnicities and genders over the years etc., was performed.

In addition to this I would like to perform EDA to:
i) Explore the distribution of male and female students in different grades
ii) How does enrollment, ethnicity distribution, and other factors change as students progress through different grades?
iii) What is the proportion of students in special education programs (sped_num) over the years?

and the like. I am sure that more questions to answer will pop up as I progress through further EDA.
